Using the member function eof:

The member function eof(End-of-file) returns a boolean true if the file reaches the end of it and false if not. 

Understanding the snippet below:

We’ll first declare an object in(any name you wish) of the type ifstream and use its open method similar to what we did above, to open the text file in the program.
And now, we’ll declare the string variable st to store the content we’ll receive from the text file sample60.txt.
Now since we not only want the first or some two or three strings present in          the text file, but the whole of it, and we have no idea of what the length of the file is, we’ll use a while loop.
We’ll run the while loop until the file reaches the end of it, and that gets checked by using eof() , which returns 1 or true if the file reaches the end. Till then a 0 or false.
We’ll use getline to store the whole line in the string variable st. Don’t forget to include the header file <string>.
This program now successfully prints the whole content of the text file.
